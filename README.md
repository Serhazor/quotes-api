# Quotes API

## What's this?
A very simple API for fetching quotes related to programming.

## Why?
The purpose of the API is to make it a bit easier to complete the freeCodeCamp [Quote Generator project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).
In the process, I want to give CodeNewbies the opportunity to contribute and practice working with git and github.

## How can I contribute?
Take a look at the open issues. If you see something you would like to try, fork the project, make a commit and open a pull request.

If you're unsure or struggling, don't be afraid to reach out.
